# IEG-Course-Project-Scripts
In this repository scripts for each task can be found. There are iterations of them for each task marked by 1,2,3 etc with 3 being the latest itaration. Graphs included in the course project may originate from any iteration
There is an unused script for Australia, please disregard
Each script name has the name of country of interest (ESP) and the number of the task next to it (ESP3). The number in parenthesis indicates the iteration of the script, e.g ProjectESP3(2) is the second iteration of the third task for Spain.
Country of interest can change for each script by changing the "country" variable with the correct tag.
